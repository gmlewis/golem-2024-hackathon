/// The `user-manager` component handles all user authentication, profiles, and info.
/// It is deployed as a singleton worker. For every user that is created, a new
/// `user` worker is spawned and kept track of by the `user-manager` (whose job
/// it is to keep track of all follows and tweets for a single user).
/// Each user is created with a globally-unique XID such that in the future, it will
/// be possible to change a user's public "@handle" easily (if the new handle is available)
/// without the need for anything else changing in the backend.
